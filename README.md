WorkoutTracker is a work-in-progress Kotlin Multiplatform project to track exercise details offline in an intuitive way.

It is built with MVVM architecture using Koin to share viewmodels, a Room database as offline persistent storage, and a
Compose UI shared across Android, IOS and Desktop. WT will remain serverless and store data locally, acting as a simple 
and quick app to store workout information without internet connection, subscriptions or AI suggestions.

Current WIP goals are:

- Room persistence
- Deployment on Play store
- Integration with smart watches
